# BumWatch

The Bumwatch is truly made for bums - it has all the features a bum needs and nothing else. A very minimalistic display displays two things - steps taken and their heart rate that updates every second. 

We live in a world full of distractions and bum-inducing items. Technology is specifically designed to make our lives easier, which is synonymous with making us more of a bum. Instead of bleeding-edge features, what a bum truly needs is an acconuntability partner that gives them only what they truly need.

The BumWatch provides the satisfaction of progress through step counting. Knowing the average resting heart rate is 60-100, this would motivate the bums to lower their heartrate through exercise because they become aware they are a bum. This is key. Finally, when the bum decides to be a bum, there is a vibration feedback that reminds them they are a bum.



This iteration of the BumWatch is made entirely in-house and costed $0 (not including time and labor). The BumWatch consists entirely of breakout boards (that I borrowed) stacked neatly and soldered to a custom-PCB that was created using an in-house PCB fabrication machines. Although I would never recommend this method (due to problems I will address later on), it was a fun process planning everything and watching everything come to fruition.
